<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
	Marigolds, native to the New World and sacred flowers of the Aztecs, journeyed across the Atlantic Ocean twice to travel 3,000 miles north of their center of origin. The lengthy journey is a testimony to the rugged durability of marigolds. Today the marigold is one of the most popular annuals grown in North American gardens.
</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>
	The earliest use of marigolds was by the Aztec people who attributed magical, religious and medicinal properties to marigolds. The first recorded use of marigolds is in the De La Crus-Badiano Aztec Herbal of 1552. The Herbal records the use of marigolds for treatment of hiccups, being struck by lightening, or "for one who wishes to cross a river or water safely". The last use confirms the magical properties ascribed to marigolds.
The Aztecs bred the marigold for increasingly large blooms. It is told that in the 1500's, native marigold seeds were taken from the Aztecs by early Spanish explorers to Spain. The marigolds were cultivated in Spain and grown in monastery gardens.
From Spain, marigold seeds were transported to France and northern Africa. The taller marigolds, now called African-American, became naturalized in North Africa.
In Mexico and Latin America, marigold flowers are used to decorate household altars to celebrate All Saints Day and All Souls Day. Flower heads are scattered on relatives’ graves which can account for the profusion of marigolds in cemeteries.
Marigolds are also used in Hindu religious ceremonies. An account describes the marigold being used as garlands to decorate village gods during the harvest festival. The traveler recalling the festival also noted that maize and peppers were exactly the same shade of orange-yellow as the marigold. It was as though the corn and peppers were selected or bred to match the marigold flower color.
Several hundred years after their initial journey from the Americas to Europe and Africa, marigolds were introduced to American gardeners. This reunion of sorts did not happen until shortly after the Revolutionary War. Marigolds were just one of many plants shipped to the young country.
Around the turn of this century, sweet peas and asters were the popular flowers in the United States. Yet both of them were becoming beleaguered by disease and declining overall performance. The time was right for a new flower to make its debut. In 1915 David Burpee took over the seed company which was founded by his father, W. Atlee Burpee. Young David felt that marigolds held promise and decided to feature them in his catalog and fund research.
Since the 1920 s marigold breeding has developed hundreds of new varieties. The odorless marigolds, white marigolds, hybrids and triploids have all been advancements in breeding. 
</p><p>
Marigolds come in different colors, yellow and orange being the most common. Most of the marigolds have strong, pungent odor and have great value in cosmetic treatment. There are many varieties of Marigolds available today.
<ul> Some of the major Marigold varieties are listed below:
<li>
African or American Marigolds (Tagetes erecta): These marigolds are tall, erect-growing plants up to three feet in height. The flowers are globe-shaped and large. Flowers may measure up to 5 inches across. African Marigolds are very good bedding plants. These flowers are yellow to orange and do not include red colored Marigolds. The Africans take longer to reach flowering stage than the French type.</li>
<li>
French Marigolds (Tagetes patula): Marigold cultivars in this group grow 5 inches to 18 inches high. Flower colors are red, orange and yellow. Red and orange bicolor patterns are also found. Flowers are smaller (2 inches across). French Marigolds are ideal for edging flowerbeds and in mass plantings. They also do well in containers and window boxes.</li><li>
Signet Marigolds (T. signata 'pumila'): The signet Marigolds produce compact plants with finely divided, lacy foliage and clusters of small, single flowers. They have yellow to orange colored, edible flowers. The flowers of signet marigolds have a spicy tarragon flavor. The foliage has a pleasant lemon fragrance. Signet Marigolds are excellent plants for edging beds and in window boxes.</li><li>
Mule Marigolds: These marigolds are the sterile hybrids of tall African and dwarf French marigolds, hence known as mule Marigolds. Most triploid cultivars grow from 12 to 18 inches high. Though they have the combined qualities of their parents, their rate of germination is low.</li></ul>
</p>
<h3 id="prop">Propagation</h3>
<p>Marigolds (Tagetes sp.) are tender annuals that cannot withstand frost. Ranging in size from tiny 8-inch dwarf varieties to towering plants of 4 feet or taller, marigolds produce an abundance of blooms from spring until frost in virtually any U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zone. These bright flowers, in shades of yellow, red and orange thrive in full sun, and prefer well-drained, moist soil. Marigolds are propagated via seeds.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types of Marigold</h3>
<h4>Tagets Cottage Red</h4>
<img src="tagets.jpg">
<p>
	Discovered in Mexico, this single, bright-red flower blooms all through the summer season. The petals of this beautiful flower are spade-shaped and have squared-off tips. It is believed to be a hybrid one. Butterflies and bees love to visit the blooms of cottage red. They grow best when exposed to the full sun, and any average well-drained soil. It is best suited for cutting gardens and mixed plantings.
</p>
<h4>Bon Bon Yellow Calendula</h4>
<img src="bon.jpg">
<p>A bushy variety, it produces bright yellow double flowers that are generally considered to decorate mixed borders and containers. The fragrant daisy lemon yellow flowers have brown eyes at the end of the stems. In the past times, people used it as a replacement of saffron to give a rich color to the butter and cheese. It has also been used to treat smallpox and measles. Also, on the battlefields, soldiers would use it as a dressing for the wounds.</p>
<h4>Tagetes Erecta Antigua Orange</h4>
<img src="tagetserecta.jpg">
<p>Best known for its bright orange and yellow golf-ball shaped flowers that bloom to about three inches. Since they don’t get sad because of the extreme hot weathers, a lot of people choose to plant them in their garden bed or containers and borders. An added advantage of Antigua orange species is that it goes well with almost every edible or blooming garden plant. Tomatoes, beans, carrots, and cabbages are some of the plants that benefit from marigold as their companion plant.

<h3 id="uses">Uses</h3>
<ol><li><h5> Lowers Inflammation and Free Radical Damage</h5></li><p>
Research shows that calendula’s dozens of active chemicals make it a natural cytotoxic, hepatoprotective and spasmogenic herb that’s been demonstrated in both animal and human experiments. Extracts taken from the flower have been shown to lower C-reactive protein and cytokine levels and protect cells from being damaged by free radicals — one of the primary causes of aging and cell deterioration. Calendula not only controls oxidative damage from free radicals that can affect delicate tissues, such as those of the eyes, but also defend against infections of the skin, GI tract and genitals caused by viruses or bacteria. (5)

In addition, research also shows that calendula marigold helps fight growth of bacteria in wounds and might even be able to reduce symptoms associated with chemotherapy and cancer treatments. (6)</p>
<li><h5>
Reduces Eye Inflammation and Conjunctivitis</h5></li><p>
Findings from animal studies show that calendula extract is capable of treating conjunctivitis and other chronic ocular inflammatory conditions.

These extracts have demonstrated antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and immuno-stimulating properties that not only reduce eye infections, but protect vision by guarding delicate tissues of the eyes from the effects of UV light, deterioration/aging and oxidative damage. (7)</p>
<li><h5>
 Has Natural Antiseptic Properties</h5></li>
One well-researched use of marigold/calendula extract is applying it in drop form to the inside of the ear canal to help treat bacterial ear infections and decrease pain. It’s been found that calendula drops can lower inner-ear swelling and inflammation within just a couple short days of use, even without the use of antibiotics in some cases.

Due to its antifungal properties, calendula can also be used to treat vaginitis/vaginal infections and jock itch. Applying an ointment or cream containing marigold/calendula, probiotic “good bacteria” like Lactobacillus sporogenes and lactic acid to the affected area of the groin/genitals for four weeks can help decrease symptoms, including pain, itchiness, burning when urinating and dryness.

<h5>Heals Skin Wounds, Burns and Rashes
</h5></li>
Historically, and still today, one of the most popular uses of calendula has been applying it to irritated skin (or to the eyelids and elsewhere) to reduce itchiness, redness, sensitivity, dryness and swelling. It’s been found that calendula has the ability to promote the growth of healthy new tissue, increase blood flow to the affected area, boost collagen production, which firms and strengthens skin, hydrate dry skin, and speed up the process of skin repair following surgery or damage.

Marigold’s ability to help treat wounds is believed to be due to stimulation of epithelial cell production, mostly as a result of the presence of glycoproteins and nucleoproteins. It’s also linked to increased cell turnover and improved collagen metabolism stimulation. In folklore medicine, marigold products were applied to various ulceration (both internal and external) and wounds to prevent infections, and even today calendula is used post-surgery to promote faster incision healing.

For those with dry, flaking or rash-prone skin, calendula can be combined with natural lubricating products like coconut oil or shea butter to improve skin hydration and firmness. In addition, marigold is used topically in order to:

reduce diaper rash and protect sensitive skin
decrease the appearance of discoloration due to scarring
reduce unsightly varicose veins
treat swollen bug bites
treat burns
reduce dermatitis and eczema
reduce bruises
heal infected cuts
soothe skin after shaving
treat ingrown hairs
reduce dandruff on the scalp
decrease other signs of poor blood flow and inflammation affecting the skin
5. Helps Reduce Hemorrhoid Pain
Because marigold treatments can promote tissue healing and reduce swelling, many find that applying it topically to the anal or genital area helps reduce symptoms of hemorrhoids or anal tears (also called anal fissures). One animal study that investigated the effects of marigold treatment on bleeding wounds found that using the product for an eight-day window resulted in almost 90 percent closure of the tissue wounds, compared to only 51 percent of those who had not used the treatment. (9)
<li>
<h5> Eases Cramps and Spasms</h5></li>
Calendula’s antispasmodic actions are beneficial for relieving muscle spasms, “charley horse” pains, stomach cramps and PMS/menstrual cramps. Marigold is able to decrease cramping by improving blood flow to the painful area and lowering inflammatory responses. (10) The florets can be consumed in tea form to help ease digestion internally and improve liver health or applied over the abdomen in ointment/extract form in order to seep into tense muscles through the skin.
<li>
<h5>Naturally Repels Bugs</h5></li>
Due to their pungent odor, antioxidant content and volatile oils, marigolds can be used to naturally repel mosquitoes, pests and other insects. This is one reason marigold flowers are commonly planted in vegetable gardens and also used in extract form in candles, room or bug sprays, and many skin lotions in order to prevent mosquito bites.

Using marigold products on your skin helps repel bites, but you can also plant the flowers directly in your yard or garden to protect soil. The flowers’ aroma works underground to keep away nematodes (microscopic worms) and other pests that can eat your crops, sometimes for up to three years after being planted, according to the Farmer’s Almanac.</p>
