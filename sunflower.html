	<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>
	Sunflowers make up the genus Helianthus. In Greek, helios means sun and anthos means flower, thus Sunflower. The genus, which contains about 67 species, is thought to be native to the Americas (North, South) originally, and were domesticated around 1000 B.C. Although, Sunflowers are now distributed almost worldwide.
</p>

	<p>
		The large, solitary Sunflower blossom, sometimes as large as a meter in diameter, is composed of yellow ray flowers and a central disk.n The Central disk is composed of either yellow, brown, or purple flowers, depending on the species. The flower is actually a head (formerly composite flower) of numerous flowers crowded together. The outer flowers on the Sunflower are the ray florets and can be yellow, maroon, orange, or other colors. These flowers are sterile. The flowers that fill the circular head inside the ray flowers are called disc florets.

Sunflower plants are cultivated in Sunflower farms for their seeds. Refined Sunflower-seed oil is edible, sunflowers have 39 to 49% oil in the seed. Sunflower seed accounts for about 14% of the world production of seed oils (6.9 million metric tons in 1985-86) and about 7% of the oilcake and meal produced from oilseeds. Sunflower oil is generally considered a premium oil because of its light color, high level of unsaturated fatty acids and lack of linolenic acid, bland flavor and high smoke points. Sunflower is the preferred and the most commonly used oil.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>The story of sunflower (Helianthus Annuus ) is indeed amazing. The wild sunflower is native to North America but commercialization of the plant took place in Russia. It was only recently that the sunflower plant returned to North America to become a cultivated crop. But it was the American Indian who first domesticated the plant into a single headed plant with a variety of seed colors including black, white, red, and black/white striped.</p>
<h3 id="prop">Propagation</h3>
<p>
	Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) has been cultivated both as an oilseed and as an ornamental plant. Several protocols have been described for the micropropagation, direct plant regeneration by organogenesis being acceptable for this plant species. Besides a strong genotype dependency, the type and ontogenic stage of explants, environmental conditions of the culture, and media composition affect sunflower organogenesis. Several problems have hindered the ability to regenerate normal shoots; the most common being hyperhydricity and precocious flowering. This chapter describes a protocol for direct shoot regeneration from cotyledons developed and established in our laboratory, as well as the improvement regenerated shoot quality.

<h3 id="type">Types of Sunflowers</h3>
<h4>Skyscraper</h4>
<img src="sun1.jpg">
<p>True to its name, the Skyscraper sunflower rises high above the ground and can reach heights of up to 12 feet.
These plants are held up by durable stalks and can produce 14 inch flower petals.</p>

<h4>Sunforest Mix</h4>
<img src="sun2.jpg">
<p>This sunflower’s height can get anywhere from 10-15 feet high and 40 inches across.
When planting these it is important to leave three to four feet between them so they have room to grow.</p>

<h4>American Giant</h4>
<img src="sun3.jpg">
<p>We recommend sectioning off a corner of your garden for this one because this sunflower can grow up to 15 feet!
With the long length off the stem and a face that grows to be about one foot in width, it is no wonder they call this sunflower the American Giant.</p>

<h4>Russian Mammoth</h4>
<img src="sun4.jpg">
<p>This sunflower’s height ranges from 9 to 12 feet high and is used in a lot of county fairs and flower shows because of its size and effortless ability to grow.
The Russian Mammoth lives best in Mediterranean climate and can propagate as early as April.</p>


<h3 id="fact">Facts about Sunflower</h3><ul>
	<li>Sunflower is the national flower of Russia and the state flower of Kansas, USA.</li>
	<li>Sunflower is notable for turning to face the Sun, a behavior known as heliotropism.</li>
	<li>Sunflowers were cultivated by Native Americans well over 1000 years ago.</li>
	<li>Sunflower heads consist of 1,000 to 2,000 individual flowers joined together by a receptacle base. The large petals around the edge of a sunflower head are individual ray flowers which do not develop into seed.</li>
	<li>Sunflower seeds have lots of calcium and 11 other important minerals. They do have 50% fat, but it is mostly polyunsaturated linoleic acid.</li>
	<li>The Modern Sunflower Kitchens have a large number of sunflower decorated items like sunflower painted crockery, Dinner sets, and living rooms with sunflower wallpaper, S. wallpaper art, S. Wallpaper borders, Sunflower rugs, Sunflower pillows.</li>
	<li>According to the 1996 Guiness Book of Records, the tallest Sunflower ever grown measured 25 feet 5 and 1/2 inches. According to the 1996 Guiness Book of Records, the smallest sunflower ever grown to maturity measured 2 and 1/5 inches. According to the 1996 Guiness Book of Records, the largest sunflower head measured 32 and 1/4 inches across.</li>
	<li>Wild Sunflower is highly branched with small heads and small seeds, in contrast to the single-stem and large seed head of domesticated sunflower. Sunflower perfumes are also popular.</li>
	<li>Golden mini Sunflowers herald sunny summer days. The carefree sunflower bouquet sends cheery wishes for all those special occasions - birthday, wedding anniversary, new baby, get well, or to simply say thanks.</li>
