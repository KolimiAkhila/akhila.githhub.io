	<h3 id="history">History of Lotus</h3>
	<p>Back in Egyptians times, the lotus flower was very important in their religion. Meaning creation and rebirth, it was a symbol of the sun, because at nightfall it closes and goes beneath the water and at dawn it climbs up above the water and reopens. It was the only plant to flower and fruit at the same time, as it would emerge as pure white from the depths of the muddy swamp and grow above the water. One myth that revolves around the lotus is during creation time a giant lotus flower grew out of a pond and from it the sun rose. Also, throughout ancient Egypt the lotus has been pictured in various works of art.  It would act as a border to outline a section of artwork, or held in the hands of a god or human. The lotus was also used in their math, helping to count to high decrees. One lotus would act as 1,000 and two lotus as 2,000 and so on.</p>

<h3 id="prop">Propagation</h3>
<p>The pink or white flowered Chinese lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) and the yellow-blooming American lotus (Nelumbo pentapetula) are aquatic plants prized as specimens in water gardens. Their underground stem is edible and the dried seed heads of the lotus are utilized in floral arrangements. Lotus plants are propagated vegetatively by dividing the underground stem, which ensures the preservation of desirable parent plant characteristics, or by seed.</p></br>

	Lotuses are found in white and pink colors in general and they grow in shallow and murky waters. Lotus flowers enjoy warm sunlight and are intolerant to cold weather. This is why the Lotus is not seen blossoming in the winter. The floating leaves and Lotus flowers have long stems, which contain air spaces to maintain the buoyancy. The Lotus is native to Asia and flourishes in a wide range of climates from India to China.

The Lotus plant is an aquatic perennial, native to southern Asia and Australia and most commonly cultivated in water gardens. The plant has its roots firmly in the mud and sends out long stems to which their leaves are attached. The leaves are sometimes, and Lotus flowers always, raised above the water surface. The beautiful and fragrant Lotus flower opens in the morning and petals fall in the afternoon.
