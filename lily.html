	<p>The botanic name Lilium is the Latin form and is a Linnaean name. The Latin name is derived from the Greek λείριον, leírion, generally assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the Madonna lily.[18][19] The word was borrowed from Coptic (dial. Fayyumic) hleri, from standard hreri, from Demotic hrry, from Egyptian hrṛt "flower".[citation needed] Meillet maintains that both the Egyptian and the Greek word are possible loans from an extinct, substratum language of the Eastern Mediterranean.[citation needed] The Greeks also used the word κρῖνον, krīnon, albeit for non-white lilies.[citation needed]

The term "lily" has in the past been applied to numerous flowering plants, often with only superficial resemblance to the true lily, including water lily, fire lily, lily of the Nile, calla lily, trout lily, kaffir lily, cobra lily, lily of the valley, daylily, ginger lily, Amazon lily, leek lily, Peruvian lily, and others. All English translations of the Bible render the Hebrew shūshan, shōshan, shōshannā as "lily", but the "lily among the thorns" of Song of Solomon, for instance, may be the honeysuckle.[20]

<p>Lilium (members of which are true lilies) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the temperate northern hemisphere, though their range extends into the northern subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their common name but are not related to true lilies.</p>
<p>
	Lily is a flowering plant that belongs to the family Liliaceae. There are hundreds of varieties of lilies that can be found mostly in the northern hemisphere (Europe, Asia and North America). Most species grow in temperate and tropical areas. Lily usually inhabits forests, grasslands, marshes and mountains. Because of their beauty, lilies are cultivated throughout the world. Lily is mainly used in decorative purposes. White lily is a symbol of good luck in Japan. This type of lily is also inevitable part of wedding bouquets around the globe. Certain types of wild lilies are endangered due to habitat loss as a result of urban development and increased agriculture. Besides that, lilies are prone to various bacterial, viral and fungal diseases.

<h3 id="history">History of Lily</h3>
<p>Created from the breast milk of Hera, wife of Zeus in Greek mythology, the lily flower is the symbol of purity. The Roman goddess of beauty Venus was so jealous of the lily’s white purity that she caused the pistil to grow from the flower’s center.

The first picture of a lily appeared in Crete around 1580 BC. These white, graceful flowers became a symbol of fertility for pagans and Christians. The Old Testament, New Testament and many other ancient books across a variety of societies mention lilies. The flowers still represent purity and abundance in Greece, where brides wear crowns made of lilies and wheat.

In most cultures in history, the lily represents purity, chastity and virtue. However, the lily is a symbol of death in some civilizations. Sprinkled on the graves of innocent children, saints and martyrs, lilies can represent purity in passing.

European explorers crisscrossed the globe, searching for medicinal plants during the Victorian era. One notable explorer, Augustine Henry, became enamored with lilies and switched the goal of his expedition from finding medicinal plants to locating new types of lilies. Lily growers developed the orange Lilium henryii, or Henry’s lily, in his honor. E.H. Wilson scoured China for lilies, eventually discovering the magnificent white Lilium regale, sometimes called the regal lily.</p>

<h3 id="types">Types of Lilies</h3>
<ul><li>
<h4>Trumpet lily</h4>
<img src="trumpetlily.jpg">

<p>


Also called an Aurelian Lily, the trumpet lily is the most iconic lily due to the trumpet shape of its blooms. Trumpet lilies are very fragrant, and can fill your house or garden with a beautiful scent. In your garden, Trumpet lilies will generally bloom before Oriental lilies and after Asiatic.</p>
<li><h4>Easter Lily</h4>
<img src="easterlily.jpg"</li>
<p>Another iconic lily, the lilium longiflorum, is a very popular lily during the Christian celebration of Easter. Easter lilies are native to the Ryukyu Islands in Japan, and the stalks can grow up to a meter high. These pristine white blooms are trumpet shaped and generally thinner than Trumpet lilies. The white blooms are out-ward facing and have a light fragrance. Although these plants are beautiful and edible for humans, the Easter Lily in particular is toxic to cats, so cat-owners should be careful about bringing these plants into their homes.</p>
<li><h4>Asiatic Lil</h4>
<img src="asiaticlily.jpg">
<p>Asiatic lilies have some of the largest blooms in the lily family, and are known for the range of colors, shapes, and patterns of the hybrids in this category. The flowers can range from soft pastels to vibrant, bold reds, pinks, oranges–any color but blue. Asiatic lilies are one of the easiest lilies to grow and care for, probably due to the high hybridization of these lilies. These lilies tend to bloom in the fall, and unlike other varieties, are typically unscented. If you like soft pinks, try planting the “Corsica” cultivar in your garden.</p></li>
<li><h4>Oriental lily</h4>
	<img src="orientallily.jpg">
	<p>Oriental lilies, like Asiatic lilies, are one of the most popular ornamental varieties of lilies. They have colossal blooms in soft colors that are often accented by freckles, stripes, or spots on the petals. While these are not the easiest lily to grow, they have lovely curled-back petals and look as though they might belong in a fairy garden. For a pretty, soft rose-colored bloom, try the “Stargazer” culti</p></li>

Lily is dormant during the winter. Flowering takes place during the spring and summer.</li><li>
Lily attracts insects with its large colorful flowers and tasteful nectar. Certain species of lily are pollinated by wind.</li><li>
Lily can reproduce from the seed, bulbs and tissue cultures.</li><li>
Only white and tiger lilies are known by their beautiful smell. Other species of lily are odorless.</li><li>
Tiger lily is a species of lily that has large, bright yellow flowers with prominent dark spots on the inner side of the petals. Similar coloration is typical for tigers which is why this species is named "tiger lily".</li><li>
Some species of lilies can be used as food. Bulbs of lily contain a lot of starch and they are used as root vegetables. Besides humans, insects, mice, squirrels and deer often eat wild lilies.</li><li>

Lily is not poisonous for humans. It is actually widely used in traditional Asian medicine for the treatment of depression and certain types of toxicities.</li><li>
Lily can survive couple of days in the vase. Removal of the pollen from the flower will prolonged lifespan in the vase and prevent development of stains on the tepals.</li><li>
Lily is perennial plant which means that it can survive more than two years in the wild.</li></ul>
<h3 id="uses">Uses</h3>
<p>
	Lilies are popular as ornamental plants. Many species of lily are widely grown in the garden in temperate and sub-tropical regions. Sometimes they may also be grown as potted plants. A large number of ornamental hybrids have been developed. They can be used in herbaceous borders, woodland and shrub plantings, and as a patio plant.

Some lilies, especially Lilium longiflorum, as well as a few other hybrids, form important cut flower crops. These tend to be forced for particular markets; for instance, L. longiflorum for the Easter trade, when it may be called the Easter lily.

Lilium bulbs are starchy and edible as root vegetables, although bulbs of some species may be very bitter. The non-bitter bulbs of L. lancifolium, L. pumilum, and especially L. brownii (Chinese: 百合 干; pinyin: bǎihé gān) are grown at large scale in China as a luxury or health food, most often sold in dry form. They are eaten especially in the summer, for their ability to reduce internal heat. They may be reconstituted and stir-fried, grated, and used to thicken soup, or processed to extract starch. Their texture and taste draw comparison with the potato, although the individual bulb scales are much smaller.

Although they are believed to be safe for humans to eat, there are reports of nephrotoxicosis (kidney failure) in cats which have eaten some species of Lilium and Hemerocallis (Langston 2002).

Lilies are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including The Dun-bar.
